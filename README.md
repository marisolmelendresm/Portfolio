<br><b>LERT (Labor Expenses Recovery Tool)</b>
	<br>Description: LERT is a web application that automates the Expenses Recovery process of IBM. In this app managers can update all the expenses in their projects, visualize how much of that expense has been recovered and report that directly to their supervisor.
<br>Programming languages used: HTML, Javascript, Python, SQL
<br>My contribution: 
<br>Delegate Page front and back.
<br>Home Page front
<br>React components
	<br>Knowledge gained from this project:
<br>Usage of design frameworks, such as Material UI
<br>DB2 databases

<br><b>Food bank app</b>
<br>Description: collaborated with Banco de Alimentos Guadalajara to solve a problem they had inside of the bank: lack of communication with the community. To do this we developed an iOS mobile app which sends automated messages to the people inside the community, shows all the bank’s social media posts and allows the user to keep in touch with the people they are helping. 
<br>Programming languages used: Swift
<br>My contribution: Frontend (Xcode)
	<br>Knowledge gained from this project:
<br>Mobile apps development for iOS operating system.
<br>Storyboards in xcode.

<br><b>Feedback app</b>
	<br>Description: using our knowledge of web development, my team and I developed a web application to solve a need that was presented to us by Amdocs. We worked with this company for the whole course of 10 weeks and delivered a functional web app in which any employee from Amdocs can submit a feedback (congratulation, complaint, suggestion or question) and get immediate help from an administrator.
<br>Programming languages used: HTML, CSS, Typescript, Python, SQL.
<br>My contribution: Login page and backend with Flask
	<br>Knowledge gained from this project:
<br>Frontend
<br>Web development in Angular
<br>Ionic framework
<br>Backend
<br>Flask
<br>Relational databases

<br><b>Snakes and Ladders: Board Game</b>
	<br>Description: Object Oriented project in which I was assigned to write code to, simulate the behavior of a board game named "Snakes and Ladders" which consists of a board (tablero) that contains boxes in which you could find either a snake or a ladder depending on your luck.
	<br>Programming languages used: C++
	Knowledge gained from this project: 
<br>Object oriented programming
C++

<br><b>Finding events</b>
	<br>Description: we used a Hash Table so that the user is
able to search an event with an specific id (ip). We used this data 
structure because of the low complexity it has when searching for a value.
It receives a file with the events ordered by date (Part 1 of the project)
and returns the event the user looked for.
	<br>Programming languages used: C++
	<br>Knowledge gained from this project:
<br>Data structures and algorithms
<br>Hash tables
<br>Algorithm complexity

<br><b>Sorting file by date</b>
<br>Description: In this part of the project my team and I were assigned to read a file with events, sort them by date and let the user search events between two dates. It receives a file with events (not ordered) and returns a file with the same events ordered by date. (Part 2 of the project)
<br>Programming languages used: C++
	<br>Knowledge gained from this project:
<br><b>Data structures and algorithms</b>
<br>Quick sort algorithm
<br>Algorithm complexity
